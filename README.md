# QB2025_ALennon 
Student QB repo for Anna Lennon <br>
My name is Anna Lennon and I am a first-year PhD student in EEB. I am a member of the Lennon lab where I study dormancy and pathogenesis. My current projects revolve around biofilm structure, composition, and resilience in B. subtilis. Outside of the lab, I enjoy figure skating and coaching, rock climbing, reading, and being involved in my church community. I am originally from Chicago, IL but did my undergraduate in Nashville, TN at Belmont University. There my research focused on an infectious disease in aquatic frogs and how it impacted their locomotor function. <br>
For QB, I am extremely excited to have more formal training in Git/Linux systems. I am completely self-taught (very poorly) and so even the first two sections of this course have been extremely formative. My personal learning goals for QB 2025 is to gain further understanding on uses of Git in particular the linguistics, expand my base R coding skills (I mainly use all the packages), and develop a more applied outlook to using R for ecology studies. <br>
